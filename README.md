An energy flow model for GEDP class with Web wrapper

To Amy Glasmeier, our wonderful teacher and friend

Introduction
============

This is a Web wrapper


Requirements
============
The interface is written in [PHP](http://php.net), it requires [gd]() with [libpng]() enabled and [mod_json]().

The backend is written in [Matlab](http://mathworks.com). Octave should work (requires changes in **image.php**)but is not tested.
